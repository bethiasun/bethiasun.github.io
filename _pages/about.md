Hi! I am a first year MPhil student at UNSW Sydney, advised by [Yang Song](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ysong/) and [Maurice Pagnucco](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~morri/). 
Previously, I completed a dual B.S at the same institution in Mathematics and Computer Science with High Distinction and an award for mathematical optimisation. I am driven by the core belief that computational models of human intelligence should go 
<i>beyond</i> optimising arbitrary performance metrics and instead, aim to enhance <i>cognitive plausibility</i>. 
My research primarily focuses on building <i>mathematically formalised, cognitively plausible</i> deep learning models and draws inspiration from a wide range of fields, including mathematics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind.
For a more detailed overview of the interests driving my current work, please see the <a href="/interests">interests</a> section. 

Outside of research, I enjoy snorkelling, travelling absurd distances in the hope of acquiring vegan-friendly baked goods and desserts, and spending time with my friends (both human and feline). 

I am always happy to discuss a variety of random topics, so feel free to <a href="mailto:bethia.sun@unsw.edu.au">reach out</a> if you're interested in having a chat!
