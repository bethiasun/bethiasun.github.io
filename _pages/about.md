Hi! I am a first year MPhil student at UNSW, advised by [Yang Song](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ysong/) and [Maurice Pagnucco](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~morri/). Previously, I completed a dual B.S at the same institution in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I am broadly interested in building cognitively-plausible computational models of human intelligence, seeking answers to questions like: 

- **The Paradox of Cognition**: As captured by  <a href="https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/smolensky.proper.treat.pdf">Smolensky's Paradox of Cognition</a>, there is an apparent need for both connectionist and symbolic systems to explain the full range of human cognitive capabilities (e.g., fluidity, statistical sensitivity, and perceptual grounding are abilites that naturally arise from the <i> neural</i> paradigm, whereas structured reasoning and compositionality naturally emerge from <i> symbolic </i> systems). How can we reconcile these seemingly incompatible frameworks into one coherent cognitive architecture that gives rise to the full scope of human cognition? I believe the answer to this is in the development of new mathematical formalisms that allow traditionally 'symbolic' capabilities to emerge naturally from completely continuous mathematics and optimisation (the 'neural' paradigm). To this end, my current work investigates the mathematical framework of the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ics/sites/default/files/attached-files/92-08.pdf">Integrated Connectionist Symbolic theory for cognition</a>.  
- **How Humans Learn So Much From So Littlet**: 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
