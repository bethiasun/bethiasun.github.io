<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! I am a first year MPhil student at UNSW, advised by <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ysong/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yang Song</a> and <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~morri/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Maurice Pagnicco</a>. Previously, I completed a dual B.S at the same institution in Mathematics and Computer Science.</p> <p>I am broadly interested in building cognitively-plausible computational models of human intelligence, seeking answers to questions like:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>The Paradox of Cognition</strong>: Can we mathematically formalise and build a computational model for a <i>unified</i> cognitive architecture that gives rise to a wide range of human abilities that presently seem to arise through either the neural or symbolic paradigms (e.g., for neural: fluidity, statistics-sensitivity and perceptual grounding, for symbolic: ).</li> <li> <strong>How Humans Learn So Much From So Little: The Child as Scientist</strong>:</li> </ul> <p>Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite <a href="http://reddit.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">subreddit</a>. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prof_pic.jpg</code> and put it in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img/</code> folder.</p> <p>Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profile</code> property of the YAML header of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages/about.md</code>. Edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_bibliography/papers.bib</code> and Jekyll will render your <a href="/al-folio/publications/">publications page</a> automatically.</p> <p>Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Font Awesome icons</a> and <a href="https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Academicons</a>, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.</p> </body></html>
