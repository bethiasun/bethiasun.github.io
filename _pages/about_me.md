Hi! I am a first year MPhil student at UNSW, advised by [Yang Song](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ysong/) and [Maurice Pagnicco](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~morri/). Previously, I completed a dual B.S at the same institution in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I am broadly interested in building cognitively-plausible computational models of human intelligence, seeking answers to questions like: 

- **The Paradox of Cognition**: Can we mathematically formalise and build a computational model for a <i>unified</i> cognitive architecture that gives rise to a wide range of human abilities that presently seem to arise through either the neural or symbolic paradigms (e.g., for neural: fluidity, statistics-sensitivity and perceptual grounding, for symbolic: ). 
- **How Humans Learn So Much From So Little: The Child as Scientist**: 


 Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
