<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! I am a first year MPhil student at UNSW Sydney, advised by <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ysong/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yang Song</a> and <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~morri/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Maurice Pagnucco</a>. Previously, I completed a dual B.S at the same institution in Mathematics and Computer Science with High Distinction and an award for mathematical optimisation. I am driven by the core belief that computational models of human intelligence should go <i> beyond </i> optimising arbitrary performance metrics and instead, aim to enhance <i> cognitive plausibility</i>. My research primarily focuses on building cognitively plausible deep learning models. To achieve this, I draw inspiration from a wide range of fields, including formal mathematics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. For a more detailed overview of the interests driving my current research, please see the <a href="/interests">interests</a> section.</p> <p>Outside of research, I enjoy snorkelling, film, travelling absurd distances in the hope of acquiring vegan-friendly baked goods and desserts, and spending time with my friends (both feline and human).</p> <p>I am always happy to discuss a variety of random topics, so feel free to <a href="mailto:bethia.sun@unsw.edu.au">reach out</a> if youâ€™re interested in having a chat!</p> </body></html>
